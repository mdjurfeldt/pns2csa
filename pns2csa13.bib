  abstract	= {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Scientists make precise,
		  testable statements about their observations and models of
		  nature. Other scientists can then evaluate these statements
		  and attempt to reproduce or extend them. Results that
		  cannot be reproduced will be duly criticized to arrive at
		  better interpretations of experimental results or better
		  models. Over time, this discourse develops our joint
		  scientific knowledge. A crucial condition for this process
		  is that scientists can describe their own models in a
		  manner that is precise and comprehensible to others. We
		  analyze in this paper how well models of neuronal networks
		  are described in the scientific literature and conclude
		  that the wide variety of manners in which network models
		  are described makes it difficult to communicate models
		  successfully. We propose a <italic>good model description
		  practice</italic> to improve the communication of neuronal
		  network models.</p>},
