  abstract	= {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>Scientists make precise,
		  testable statements about their observations and models of
		  nature. Other scientists can then evaluate these statements
		  and attempt to reproduce or extend them. Results that
		  cannot be reproduced will be duly criticized to arrive at
		  better interpretations of experimental results or better
		  models. Over time, this discourse develops our joint
		  scientific knowledge. A crucial condition for this process
		  is that scientists can describe their own models in a
		  manner that is precise and comprehensible to others. We
		  analyze in this paper how well models of neuronal networks
		  are described in the scientific literature and conclude
		  that the wide variety of manners in which network models
		  are described makes it difficult to communicate models
		  successfully. We propose a <italic>good model description
		  practice</italic> to improve the communication of neuronal
		  network models.</p>},

abstract ={Biological nervous systems and the mechanisms underlying their operation exhibit astonishing complexity. Computational models of these systems have been correspondingly complex. As these models become ever more sophisticated, they become increasingly difficult to define, comprehend, manage and communicate. Consequently, for scientific understanding of biological nervous systems to progress, it is crucial for modellers to have software tools that support discussion, development and exchange of computational models. We describe methodologies that focus on these tasks, improving the ability of neuroscientists to engage in the modelling process. We report our findings on the requirements for these tools and discuss the use of declarative forms of model description—equivalent to object–oriented classes and database schema—which we call templates. We introduce NeuroML, a mark–up language for the neurosciences which is defined syntactically using templates, and its specific component intended as a common format for communication between modelling–related tools. Finally, we propose a template hierarchy for this modelling component of NeuroML, sufficient for describing models ranging in structural levels from neuron cell membranes to neural networks. These templates support both a framework for user–level interaction with models, and a high–performance framework for efficient simulation of the models.},
