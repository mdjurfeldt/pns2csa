\begin{abstract}
  Most neuronal network simulators provide simulator­specific methods
  for specifying connectivity.  In addition, several universal
  description languages for neuronal network models (e.g. PyNN,
  NeuroML and NineML) have been developed in the recent
  years. Usually, there is a choice between explicitly specifying
  individual connections or selecting one of a predefined set of
  connection primitives, such as different forms of random
  connectivity. Common primitives are well suited for building random
  balanced networks, synfire chains and recurrent networks without
  much structure. However, they often either lack the required
  expressiveness or their implementations lack the required
  computational efficiency to specify the connectivity of complex
  hierarchical network models now under investigation.

  The connection­set algebra (CSA; Djurfeldt, Neuroinformatics
  10(3):287­304; 2012) is a general formalism for specifying the
  connectivity of neuronal network models. CSA provides operators to
  form more complex sets of connections from simpler ones and also
  provides parameterization of such sets, and thus allows to express
  connectivity from its small­scale to its large­scale structure. The
  CSA is expressive enough to describe a wide range of connectivities
  and can serve as a concise notation for network structure in
  scientific writing as well as in model description code for neural
  simulations. CSA implementations allow for scalable and efficient
  representation of connectivity in parallel neuronal network
  simulators. The expressiveness of CSA makes prototyping of network
  structure easy.

  Here, we describe the Python implementation of CSA and its use in
  the context of the neural simulation tool NEST (Gewaltig and
  Diesmannn, Scholarpedia 2(4):1430; 2007) and the
  simulator­independent specification language PyNN (Davison et al.,
  Front. Neuroinf. 2:11; 2009).  We developed an interface (the
  ConnectionGenerator) that abstracts the simulator and the connection
  generating library from each other, making both the simulator and
  the connectivity description library replaceable. We demonstrate how
  CSA can be used for the specification of connectivity in PyNN and
  how using CSA as a high­level representation of connectivity
  patterns when transferring the model description to NEST avoids
  performance penalties and results in good scalability.
