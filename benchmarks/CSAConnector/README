Introduction
------------
These benchmarks will compare the performance of PyNN's CSAConnector
and the CSAConnector from the NEST backend using Python CSA (csa) and
the C++ version of CSA (libcsa). The benchmarks are run for different
numbers of neurons by the script do_bench.sh. Please adapt them as
needed.

Plotting
--------
The graphs are created by the script plot_bench.sh. To extract the
data from the files created by do_bench.sh, use

    grep -h \.CSAConnector *.log > data.log

The plotting script uses svg_utils for Python to assemble multiple
panels into one publication ready figure. svg_utils is available from
https://github.com/btel/svg_utils. Convert the resulting SVG files to
PDF using something like

    inkscape --export-pdf=CSAConnector.pdf CSAConnector.svg
